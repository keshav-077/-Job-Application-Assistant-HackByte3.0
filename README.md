        <h1>üöÄ Job Search Automation</h1>

        <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
        <p>
            Job hunting in 2025 still feels like it‚Äôs stuck in 2010. Open 20 tabs, refresh job boards, copy-paste the same cold email, hope it lands somewhere other than a recruiter‚Äôs trash. It‚Äôs exhausting, repetitive, and wildly inefficient.
        </p>

        <h2>Problem It Solves</h2>
        <p>If you're a job seeker, chances are you‚Äôve:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spent more time scrolling job boards than actually applying.</li>
            <li>Played detective trying to find the elusive ‚ÄúHiring Manager‚Äôs‚Äù email.</li>
            <li>Fired off 20 generic cold emails and heard back from zero.</li>
            <li>Lost track of where you applied, when, and to whom.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We figured: what if the job search could feel less like a full-time job?</p>

        <h2>What This Project Actually Does</h2>
        <p>Just give us a one-line prompt like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>"Data Analyst in Bangalore"</code></li>
            <li><code>"Backend Developer in Berlin"</code></li>
            <li><code>"Marketing Manager, Remote"</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>And we‚Äôll handle the rest‚Äîliterally.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scrapes jobs from platforms like LinkedIn, compiles them into a clean, deduplicated dataset (title, company, location, and links).</li>
            <li>Finds recruiter details, including names and email addresses (when available ‚Äî and we're good at digging).</li>
            <li>Generates AI-powered cold emails & personalized cover letters using your resume as context.</li>
            <li>Automatically sends those emails to recruiters. No <code>Ctrl+V</code> needed.</li>
            <li>Returns a single Google Sheet with every job, contact, and email status for easy tracking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Makes It Awesome</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One prompt, many jobs. No more juggling tabs or logging into 5 job sites.</li>
            <li>AI does your talking. Personalized cold emails that don‚Äôt sound like they were written by a robot (even though, technically, they were).</li>
            <li>Automated outreach. Recruiters get pinged without you lifting a finger.</li>
            <li>Live job tracker. A Google Sheet with everything you need ‚Äî no guesswork, no confusion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who's It For?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Job seekers tired of the rinse-and-repeat application cycle.</li>
            <li>Career switchers who need to hit volume fast.</li>
            <li>Career coaches helping clients scale outreach without burnout.</li>
        </ul>
